          A typical 45-kilo (100-pound) adult spends as long as 12 hours eating 12
          to 38 kilos (26â€“84 lb) of bamboo a day. Pandas can reach 150 kg (330
          lb) in captivity and eat even more! When not eating and looking for
          food, pandas sleep most of the rest of the time. In the wild, giant
          pandas sleep for two to four hours between feeds.
