          Dinosaurs became extinct around 66 million years ago. An astroid hit
          Earth which made lots of dust and dirt rise into the air. This blocked
          the sun and made Earth very cold. One of the main theories is that
          because the climate changed, the dinosaurs could not survive and
          became extinct.
