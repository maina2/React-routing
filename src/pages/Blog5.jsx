          The memory of elephants is legendary, and for good reason. Of all land
          mammals, elephants possess the largest brains.2 They have the ability
          to recall distant watering holes, other elephants, and humans they
          have encountered, even after the passage of many years. Elephants
          transmit their wealth of knowledge from generation to generation
          through the matriarchs, and this sharing of information has been
          beneficial to the creaturesâ€™ survival.
