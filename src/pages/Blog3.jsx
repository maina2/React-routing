          Sumatran rhinos are the smallest of all rhinos, but they can still
          weigh 600kg (thatâ€™s almost 95 stone). On the other hand, white rhinos
          are the largest of the rhino species, weighing up to 3,500 kg. That is
          more than 550 stones, or well over 3 tonnes, which is mighty
          impressive considering they mainly eat grass and leaves
